# put

An old web browser feature [1][2] that got lost to time is the ability for the user to edit documents right inside the browser.

This extension, `put`, adds a button to the tool bar that will send the current document to the origin server using a HTTP PUT request.

Use it in conjunction with the Rich Text Editor at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/design-mode-pages-rich-te/omdilgkadhcoliihkpbgpkdcpogkbhah and a web server that accepts HTTP PUT and replaces the resource if it gets one.

This way you can just edit documents right in the browser and then upload them using `put`.

# Installation

To to chrome://extensions, enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner and then load the extension using the "Load unpacked" button.
Then click on the "extensions" button in the tool bar (it looks like a puzzle piece) and pin the `put` extension to the toolbar by clicking on the pin.
